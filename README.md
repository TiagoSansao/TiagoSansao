### ðŸ˜ƒ &nbsp;A little brief on who I am

EnchantÃ©e, I'm a back-end developer who has been in the development market since I was 16. I started out as a full-stack developer, but gradually made my way just to the back-end side. My preferred environment to work is in Node.js (TypeScript), but I can handle myself with other languages too. Recently, I became very interested in software architecture and design. At the moment I'm writing this, I'm reading the book Clean Architecture, by Uncle Bob, and started to produce content for Instagram, [@tiagosansaodev](https://www.instagram.com/tiagosansaodev/)</a>.

Off-topic things, so you can know me:

- Most of my childhood was spent in making Minecraft servers
- I'm a really curious person. And, since I read Atomic Habits, I've become a little into neuroscience
- FYI, most chats with me might end with dopamine and the cerebral rewarding system being debated
- I also like to invest and to accompany the market
- And, I'm learning French on Duolingo

### ðŸ“š &nbsp;About my experience

So, first of all, I think tools are only tools and I really value knowing the logic implemented **under the abstractions**. Nonetheless, I guess it's still useful for me to list here some experiences I've had. I've designed systems following architectural designs, like **three-layer-architecture**, among these systems were: **REST APIs**, **Chatbots**, and **CRUD Microservices**. On the other side, even though I'm not too much into front-end anymore, I've built **corporate web applications** with **React** and **cross-platform mobile applications** with React Native. That became a handful to me, since I've been well aware of both sides' context and, therefore, able to **guide the team** when it came to the whole **project designing and integrating**, also solving conflicts.

About the tool stack I used to implement what I said above, I can mention:

- Node.js + Express.js
- TypeScript (I love OOP paradigm)
- Python + FastAPI
- Prisma ORM + Postgres/MongoDB
- CI Pipeline (SCA, SAST, Unit tests, linting...)
- Container orchestration with Docker
- Linux based environments

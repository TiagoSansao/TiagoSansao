### ðŸ˜ƒ &nbsp;A little brief on who I am

EnchantÃ©e, I'm a back-end developer who has been in the development market since I was 16. I started out as a full-stack developer, but gradually made my way just to the back-end side. My preferred environment to work is in Node.js (TypeScript), but I can handle myself with other languages too. Recently, I became very interested in software architecture and design. At the moment I'm writing this, I'm reading the book Clean Architecture, by Uncle Bob, and started to produce content for Instagram, [@tiagosansaodev](https://www.instagram.com/tiagosansaodev/)</a>.

Off-topic things, so you can know me:

- Most of my childhood was spent in making Minecraft servers
- Since I read Atomic Habits, I've become a little into neuroscience
- I also like to invest and to accompany the market
- And, I'm learning French on Duo (;
